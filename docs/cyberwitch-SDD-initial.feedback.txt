
Hi, CyberWitch team ----

Good job on the Preliminary SDD!

You're changing the name of the game?  If that's a "yes", make sure you also
update the name of your git...  We don't want Dr. Toal getting lost!

Good idea to provide soft links to the SRS.  Also, your menu screen is very
pretty!

Just a couple of things to address:
1) is this complete?  I'm not sure that everything is there, even at the
   preliminary level...
2) the use case diagram doesn't show any use cases.  Maybe think in terms of
   operations that the game will perform, or pick one scenario and put ovals
   for all the operations that are involved with that.
3) the state diagram should be more a set of game states, with the lines labeled
   to show the actions that move the game from state to state

Very nice work.

Fix these items in the next release for full credit on the document.

You have 10% out of 10% which is an A-plus.

Regards,
Prof. Johnson
