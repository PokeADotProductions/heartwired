# 4.1   Plan Introduction

This Software Development Plan provides the details of the planned development for the Heartwired application, a 2D puzzle-platformer video game that users will be able to download and play on both Mac/PC. In developing the game, each member of the team will be programming features in weekly sprints before coming together and consolidating the best possible version of the product. The developers will be using Windows PC computers and Unreal Engine Blueprints throughout the development of the project, in teamwork with assets created and imported from Maya 3D Software.

# 4.4 Project Schedule 

Since Heartwired will be built upon in increasing complexity, the development of the game will be split into weekly sprints, starting with basic functionality that will grow into complex features interacting and relying on each other. These sprints are our best projection of the time that it will take to program these features into the game; if the time required for these tasks does not align with our schedule, we will adjust as follows with our three weeks of buffer space.

A detailed description of the sprint schedule follows:

Week 1:
  * Ability to move and jump
  * Collision
  * Switching
  * Camera transitioning between screens
  * Menu system to load into menu

Week 2:
  * Platforming: jump
  * Follow at all points
  * Permanently moving platforms
  * Camera transition between screens and levels
  * All menus
  
Week 3:
  * Saving/Loading system
  * Character follows unless told to hold
  * Character switching
  * Enemies present and detecting at a range and moving
  * Begin adding in rough animations
  * Pause Men

Week 4:
  * Collision is functional
  * Linking animations
  * Switches can be linked to certain types of environments
  * Follow AI can sometimes detect when it cannot follow
  * Health system
  * Bear attacking
  * Preliminary hookshot

Week 5:
  * Checkpoints
  * HUD system
  * All types of hookshot independently
  * Bear charge
  * Sneak
  * Enemy AI complete without fine-tuning

Week 6:
  * All animations imported
  * All animations smoothly transition
  * Hookshot toggling and choosing correct destination
  * Hookshot rope
  * Menu animations
  * Marker when other avatar is on other screen
  * Toggling characters when on other screen
  
Week 7: 
  * Saving completed levels and not reloading them as they are
  * Ability cooldowns
  * Locking out switching on ability use
  * World select

Understanding the importance of testing our game early and often, we have allocated time for playtesting throughout the semester. For more details on the abilities we will be tackling in our sprints, please see our Requirements Specifications Document.
