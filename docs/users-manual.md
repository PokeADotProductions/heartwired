This document presents the User's Manual for the Heartwired User's Manual 

#### Installation and Execution
To install the software, the user downloads the packaged Heartwired application. Executing the software is simple - the user can just double click and run the installed application from their computer. The user can stop the software from any screen in the game by pressing the “Exit Game” button. To uninstall the software, the user can delete the packaged Heartwired application from their computer. 
How to use every feature and function of the software. This might be in several sections of the manual, with the simplest stuff first in its own section, and the more complicated (and advanced) functions later.

#### Features and Functions
When the user opens the installed game, they will be presented with a menu screen. They can press “New Game” to open the tutorial and start the game from the beginning, or they can press “Load Game” to open a previously saved file, if it exists.

The user can operate the characters with the arrow or “WASD” keys. Ability keys are taught in the game, but are always mapped to the “C,” “V,” or “B” keys. 
Within the game itself, the user is able to hit the “P” key to access the pause menu and return to the Main Menu or quit the game.
