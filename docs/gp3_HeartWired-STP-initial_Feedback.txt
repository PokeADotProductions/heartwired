Hi, HeartWired team ----

Very good work implementing a difficult document for your project type.

You have captured the idea most bodaciously.

Nothing to fix for this one.  I like the way you have presented the various
activities that each character must perform, and structured it like a sort
of "checklist".

One thing that's missing is the module dependencies section.  I know it
seems redundant, but in the industry, even if a section is empty, it still
must be accounted for in the document.  Usually it will be the section
header, followed by a one-liner that says, "This section is not applicable"
or something of that nature.  Quality Assurance people *LIVE* to find that
kind of pea-dinkly stuff and flag you on it.  Just FYI.....

You have 10% out of 10% for this document, which is an A-plus.

Nice work!
